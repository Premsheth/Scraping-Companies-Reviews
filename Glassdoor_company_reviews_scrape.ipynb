       "[\"Percolate's had some hiccups over the past couple of months, including hiring too many sellers at too quickly of a pace. Companies experience growing pains all the time, and Percolate is no different. Also important to keep in mind that this is a start-up. If you're looking for a large, stable company, Percolate might not be the best option for you. The people who excel here are able to be flexible, and okay with change.Percolate hired a CFO late last year who came in and restructured. Only a couple of teams were impacted. Shortly after, the CFO presented a plan to the company at an all hands meeting, and the transparency was much appreciated. I believe company morale is rising now that things have settled down.\",\n",

       " 'I can confirm that previous reviews of fear-mongering and intimidation from the c-suite are accurate. Emails telling employees that they are doing a piss-poor job - but with more swearing- and an overall attitude in meetings is just the start. Only a few sellers are praised, though many of the sales people we celebrate sell fictional features and poorly constructed deals. We are often being told to say Yes to any prospects\\' questions, and are put in a place to lie and lose any personal credibility while making a quick buck. This backfires. I agree that communication and leadership from the top is non-existent unless it is a rude email. Leadership is also quick to embarrass or contradict employees under the bus in a meeting of the price is not right or if I say we do not have a specific feature. People have mentioned that benefits being taken away is an issue. Free food, an education stipend, and a small $200 wellness stipend have all been taken away from employees. When management asks for feedback on how the company is doing on anonymous surveys, the questions and comments that are negative are met with mean responses over email and say \"if you do not like being a seller at Percolate, you should leave.\" Everyone is anxious for the reasons above.The biggest con mentioned above is the continuous lying that our team does to prospects and existing clients.

Explain to me how this is the company\\'s way of investing in our future vs. the employee investing solo.-Employee recognition is non-existent. In a world where good help is hard to come by, the least you can do is look to reward employees for going above and beyond their job description. Company outings & holiday party are nothing more than an \"all you can drink\" at the local watering hole. You are what you attract.
